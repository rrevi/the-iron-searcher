# The Iron Searcher

A text file searching tool like The Silver Searcher, but in Crystal.

I also wrote the equivalent of in Ruby as a separate [exercise][1]. I implore you to go read the [README][2] for some history.

This is an **EDUCATIONAL** endeavor of my part, to mimic The Silver Searcher tool using the Crystal language concurrency feaures (and to a lesser degree learn how to write a CLI program in Crystal).

### What's in a name?

The Iron Searcher. The periodic table symbol for the element Iron is *fe*. Iron ions are what give Aquamarine the color blue. Aquamarine, is a variety of Beryl. The largest known naturally occurring crystal is a crystal of Beryl. Go read more about all this [here][3].

## Usage
